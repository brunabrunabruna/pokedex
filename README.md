# POKEDEX WEB APP ðŸ’¥

Goal: To build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads
data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

### Overview

- Initially this application was coded in HTML/CSS/JS
- Afterwards I reworked the whole app structure to implement Bootstrap (specially the Modal and Navbar Features).

- Pokemon data loaded from https://pokeapi.co/

- Contains a list with 150 pokemons
- Click on a pokemon for more detailed information
- Hovering on pokemon image inside card reveals âœ¨shinyâœ¨ version!
