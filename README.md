# POKEDEX WEB APP ðŸ’¥

Goal: To build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads
data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

### Overview

-Initially this application was coded in HTML/CSS/JS
-Afterwards I reworked the whole app structure to implement Bootstrap (specially the Modal and Navbar Features).

-Pokemon data loaded from https://pokeapi.co/

-contains a list with 150 pokemons
-click on a pokemon for more detailed information
-hovering on pokemon image inside card reveals âœ¨shinyâœ¨ version!
